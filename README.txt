This repository contains projects done while I was a student at Clarkson University. 
The first level directories are the source on which the files were created or store.
There are files shared throughout these directories as some needed to be tested in different environments.
For example, C on WSL Ubuntu was C 11 and on Clarkson Polaris Linux it was < C 98 so sometimes professors couldn't get code to compile on it.
