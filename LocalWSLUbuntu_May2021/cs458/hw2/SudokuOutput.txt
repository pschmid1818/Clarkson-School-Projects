timeout

When run I get timeout, this was after I corrected a typp in the given cells.
Before it had two 1's in the top row and gave an unsat, this is expected.
Without the any of given it gaves a sat, which is also expected.
However, without the given now, it gives a timeout as well.
I think there may be an issue with rise4fun.

--- On Refresh
sat
timeout

This is without (get-model) so there isnt much I can say besides that it is sat with
4 1 3 1
2 3 4 2
1 4 2 3
3 2 1 4
When I try to do it with (get-model) it just times out.
