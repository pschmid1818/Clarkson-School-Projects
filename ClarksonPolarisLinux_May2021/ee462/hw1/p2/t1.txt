“We knew the world would not be the same. 
A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. 
I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture the Bhagavad Gita. 
Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty and, to impress him, 
takes on his multi-armed form and says ‘Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.’ 
I supposed we all felt that, one way or another.”
